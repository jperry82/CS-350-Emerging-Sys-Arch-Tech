# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech
This repository contains a smart thermostat prototype using the TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL board. It reads room temperature via I2C, controls an LED for heating status, and simulates server communication through UART. The project integrates peripherals and uses a task scheduler to handle time-based and event-driven tasks.
